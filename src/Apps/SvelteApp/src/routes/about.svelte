	<p class='text-lg mb-4 text-purple-100'>
		I've been meaning to give Svelte a go for a long time now and also wanted to get my head around JWT authentication so I decided to build a simple Christmas Quiz app to see how I get on.
	</p>
	<p class='text-lg mb-4 text-purple-100'>
		So as mentioned the frontend is Svelte and with it I am using the brilliant Tailwind CSS framework for styling. In the background I've got a dotnet 6 web api using Entity Framework and interacting with a Postgres database.
		Hopefully by the time you read this the backend is running via docker containers, something else I've been meaning to properly implement for too long.

	<p class='text-lg mb-4 text-purple-100'>
		All of the source code is available on <a href='https://github.com/Chris-Mingay/blazor-christmas' target='_blank' class='underline'>Github</a>.

		If you gave the quiz a go, I hope you enjoyed it! Merry Christmas everyone.
